      <p>Born in '71, Austin native, Charles "Aaron" Ramirez spent most of his adult life working for the Sheriff's office down in San Marcos while raising 3 girls.
        Unhappy, Aaron left Hays county in April, 2015. <br><br>
        With his girls grown, this empty-nester thought he had some time to decide on another career path to follow.
        What he didn't count on was starting over. <br><br>
        Career-wise, yes. Kids, no. <br><br><br>
        Then Aaron and his wife Dawna found out one of their daughters was struggling with drug addiction when CPS took her two youngest kids away. <br> Lucy, now 10 months old, and her brother Cristian, now 2, were placed with their grandparents, pending the outcome of their mother's case with CPS. <br><br>
        With time running out and their daughter's unwillingness to complete the treatments required by the court, the adoption of Aaron and Dawna's grandchildren is an inevitability that looms closer every day. <br><br><br>
        So Aaron, who was first introduced to computers as a teenager in the '80's, decided to plunge head-first into the competitive job market of web development. With his enrollment into Austin Coding Academy's full-stack bootcamp, Aaron knows he is giving himself and his grandkids the best chance at a better life.
