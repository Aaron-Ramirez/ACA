                with todays mix of hip-hop and R&B. <br><br> Since the 2001 debut of Songs In A Minor, the New York native has built an unparalleled repertoire of hits and accomplishments and clearly established herself as one of the best-selling
                artists of the decade. Alicia prefers the Yamaha silent pianos, such as the C6S and C7S, to create her musical masterpieces that have earned her devoted fans all around the world.

                </a> <br> <br> Rick Allen joined British rock band Def Leppard when he was 15 years old and by 16 was out touring the world. Less than four years later, Def Leppard released Pyromania which established them as a worldwide success and Rick
                as a young drum superstar. While on break from recording the band's follow-up record, Rick lost his left arm in a horrific car crash on New Year's Eve in 1984.

                </a> <br><br> Lee Sklar has been a prominent figure among Hollywood session bassists dating back to the 1970's and ever since. Sklar has more than 2000 albums to his credit (and still counting), and is considered to be one of the "A" players
                in the highly selective L.A. rock music community where the competition for recording dates is fierce, and where only the strongest will survive.
